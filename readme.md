#React Weather App
This weather app was created as part of The Complete React Developer Course from Udemy. I have added on to the app to support more weather information and both Fahrenheit and Celsius for units. 

This app takes advantage of Foundation components, the OpenWeatherMap API, and Axios for the API call. React Router is used to link to "About", "Example", and "Get Weather" pages. Users can also search the weather from the navbar, and their selected unit will be used for the API call either way.
